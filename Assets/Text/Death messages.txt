--General--
You died, don't worry, it won't be the first time
You failed, you went against the storm to get home, and are now as dead as can be
Your home is the thing you fight for, but apparently your home didn't mean much, considering how weakly you fought
You sought to go home, even though there were a bloody blizzard in the way, genius, really
One death here, one death there, it's like you don't even try
And from the void you hear the whispers of the stars, they say nothing, because you're dead
As your mind fades, you wonder what could mean so much to you that you would face a blizzard and certain death, just for the chance to see it
All things end, yours just a bit prematurely, considering your options


--Falls--
I see you wondered what were at the bottom of that chasm, how intriguing
Well done, not only did you die, you died by falling into a hole! Your parents must be proud
I mean, sure, the chasm is interesting, but you're kind of trying to get home, aren't yah?
And you fell and were quickly forgotten, like we all will be when our insignificant lives are over and none remember our meaningless lives

--Fire--
I see you failed to not freeze to death. Maybe try a bonfire next time
Oh my, cold, aren't we?
F-f-f-f-freezing to death seems to be in today
And from the depths of the snow, your soul howled, failing to get home
And your eyes grew heavy, and before you you see all you have lost, and you embrace the coming darkness
And in the flames you saw what you sought, you saw your home...and now it is gone, forgotten, much like you, really

--Apples--
So you managed not to freeze to death...but you know, you still need some apples
Good to see you have your priorities stright, bonfires and not falling into a hole, although I do wonder why you didn't get yourself some food
ah, if only you had an apple
An apple a day stops the house from runnng farther away
oh my, you forgot your apple, seems like this is your home now
An apple here, an apple there...wait, you forgot to eat? How emberrasing
You know what they say, some people just work too hard and forget to eat.
Well, good job on not dying...oh wait, you forgot an apple
